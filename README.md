## Adaptive Array in C
This project implements a general adaptive array in the C language. An adaptive array dynamically changes its size to accommodate any reference to a negative index, returning NULL for indices where no value has been placed.

# Overview
The adaptive array provides the following functionalities:

Dynamically resizes itself to handle negative indices.
Returns NULL for indices where no value has been set.
Supports insertion and retrieval of values at arbitrary indices.
For detailed information on the operations and usage of the adaptive array, refer to the ADT_definition.pdf file attached.
